# Eduardo Zepeda's resume and CV (Curriculum Vitae)

This is a LaTeX template for my resume and CV (Curriculum Vitae), based on [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) and customized by me.

## How to Use

### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.  (It's generally a few years behind.)

### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
$ xelatex {your-cv}.tex
```

This should result in the creation of ``{your-cv}.pdf``

You can also clone this repository and execute make

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/EduardoZepeda/resume-and-cv-eduardo-zepeda
$ make
```

This command will generate pdf and png files in the examples directory.
